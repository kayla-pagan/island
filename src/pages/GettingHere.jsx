                                Taniti is served by a small airport, that can accommodate small 
                                jets and propeller planes. We are in the process of expanding the 
                                airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the 
                                next few years. Although our airport is small, it is well-equipped, 
                                with modern amenities to ensure a smooth arrival. The airport features 
                                a duty-free shop, a few small cafes, and a tourist information desk where 
                                you can get maps, brochures, and tips for your stay.
